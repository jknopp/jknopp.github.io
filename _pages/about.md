I am a passionate software developer currently working remotely. I have an interest in the 12-factor app methodology, and open-source tooling such as .Net Core, Docker, Terraform, Vue, Webpack, and many others. I come from a Microsoft background with an MCSD: Web Applications Solutions Developer Certification, a strong use of Visual Studio, and a passion for DevOps principals/techniques.

Working as a backend developer at digital agencies with clients in .NET for over 8 years, and Kentico for over 5 years, I've delivered cloud-based CMS architecture and solutions varying from single-page apps to large enterprise projects. I have led development on projects in many industries including Healthcare, ECommerce and Financial and orchestrated integrations with various 3rd party systems and development teams.
