I am a passionate software developer currently working remotely. I have an interest in the 12-factor app methodology, and open-source tooling such as .Net Core, Docker, Terraform, Vue, Webpack, and many others. I come from a Microsoft background with an MCSD: Web Applications Solutions Developer Certification, a strong use of Visual Studio, and a passion for DevOps principals/techniques.
